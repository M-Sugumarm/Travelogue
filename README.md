# Travelogue 

A small React app built for the ProU Frontend assessment. It displays curated mini-trip cards using mock JSON data. Focus: UI/UX, interactivity, clean code.

## What I built
- Responsive React app (Vite)
- Search, favorites (localStorage), modal details
- Clean component structure and simple styles

## Tech stack
- React 18 (Vite)
- react-router-dom
- CSS for styling
