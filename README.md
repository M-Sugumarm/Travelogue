# Travelogue — ProU Frontend Assessment

A small React app built for the ProU Frontend assessment. It displays curated mini-trip cards using mock JSON data. Focus: UI/UX, interactivity, clean code.

## What I built
- Responsive React app (Vite)
- Search, favorites (localStorage), modal details
- Clean component structure and simple styles

## Tech stack
- React 18 (Vite)
- react-router-dom
- CSS for styling

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Run dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:

```powershell
npm run build; npm run preview
```

## Notes & assumptions
- Data is local (src/data/trips.json). Replace with API if needed.
- Images use Unsplash links (hotlink) for demo only.
- No authentication implemented.

## Bonus / Next steps
- Deploy to Netlify/Render
- Add filters by tag, sort and pagination
- Add unit tests

## Screenshots
Add screenshots or short recording of the app here before submission.
